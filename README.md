# Infomap Network Navigator
This is an interactive zoomable map for networks clustered with Infomap. We took it and adapted it to multi-layer network data. There are two examples of json files that can be uploaded in this repo - multilayer.json and shai_data.json.

### How to run the app
First, you need to run the python server, JsonToFtree using pychram or using the command 'python app.py' on your localhost console, and then 'npm start' to the network-navigator.

## components/LoadNetwork.js
This is the first component thatâ€™s being uploaded. We added the "Load json file" button to uploaded the json file that describe the network. After you choose the one of the json files, the json file sent to a server JsonToFtree which transforms the json file to ftree and sends it back. After the ftree file returns, we are paring it using parseFTree and turn it to an object that can be transformed to a netowrk. After that, the ftree objects are sent to networkFromFtree function that turnes them to a network object and uploads it.

## io/ftree.js
Containing the parseFTree function, the function recieves the ftree file, and parses it to a new object that can be transformed to a network. We added the option to add attributes to the nodes and inter-links edges to the network.

## components/NetworkNavigator.js
Responsible for the rendering. We added the option for changing the size of the nodes and the color.

##  lib/network.js
Represent the network object.

## lib/network-layout.js
All the d3 shapes and colors are configured in this file.


Changes made from the upstream mapequation/network-navigator:
* Changed Shape of the layers to poligon and shpae of the nodes to ellipse.
* option of atrributes for each node, and present them in the side bar under selected node.
* Changing the size of the node by degree.
* Change the color of the node by degree or by one of the numeric values of the attributes.
