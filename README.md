# Infomap Network Navigator
This is an interactive zoomable map for networks clustered with Infomap. We took it and adapted it to multi-layer network data. There is two examples of json file that can be uploaded in this repo - multilayer.json and shai_data.json.

## LoadNetwork.js
This is the first component that uploaded. We added the "Load json file" button to uploaded the json file that describe the network.
